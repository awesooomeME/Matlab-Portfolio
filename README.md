# Matlab_Portfolio
This Repository will hold accumulations of Matlab projects that I did for personal use or projects I have done with previous clients (with their permission). All projects provided here are for demonstration purposes only, thus, its source code are not available for viewing.

I am still at the process of collating all projects that I have done over the span of 6 years using Matlab. The projects currently inccluded are projects I put out the past few days in time of writing, to give potential clients an idea on my knowledge in Matlab.
